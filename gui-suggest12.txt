Suggestion 12: Error Handling Pattern Consistency

PROBLEM:
Ensure consistent error handling pattern across all file operations.

CURRENT GOOD PATTERN (_save_data_to_file):
1. Log the error
2. Show user messagebox
3. Update status bar

SOLUTION:
Apply this pattern consistently to all user-facing operations:

```python
def _operation_with_files(self):
    try:
        # File operation
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
        messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Operation failed: {e}")
        self.update_status(f"Error: {e}")
```

AREAS TO CHECK:
- File loading operations
- Import/export functions
- Configuration save/load

BENEFITS:
- Consistent user experience
- Better error visibility
- Proper error logging
