## Guide Creation and Text-to-Speech Tool Development

### Work Completed:

1. Created comprehensive guides:
   - use-Markdown.txt
   - use-Docker.txt
   - use-DockerHub.txt
   - (Previously created) use-Tcl.txt

2. Developed text-to-speech tools:
   - read_use_file.py (GUI application)
   - read_use_file_cli.py (Command-line utility)
   - read_use.sh (Simple shell script launcher)

3. Created documentation:
   - USE_FILE_READER_README.md

All guides contain detailed examples and comprehensive information about their respective topics. The text-to-speech utilities provide a way to listen to any guide through a user-friendly interface with adjustable speed and volume controls.
