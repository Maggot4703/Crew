# COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO USING GITHUB

## 1. Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to work together on projects from anywhere in the world, track changes to code, manage project versions, and maintain documentation. GitHub has become an industry standard for open-source and private development projects.

### Key Features:
- Version control using Git
- Repository hosting (public and private)
- Issue tracking
- Pull requests for code review and collaboration
- Project management tools (Projects, Milestones)
- Documentation hosting via GitHub Pages
- CI/CD integrations via GitHub Actions
- Social coding features (stars, following, feeds)

## 2. Getting Started with GitHub

### Creating an Account

1. Visit https://github.com/
2. Click "Sign up" and enter your email address, password, and username
3. Verify your email address
4. Choose your plan (Free or Pro)

### Setting Up Your Profile

1. Add a profile picture (avatar)
2. Update your bio and information
3. Add your location, company, and website
4. Pin important repositories to your profile

### Installing Git

Before using GitHub effectively, you need Git installed on your computer:

**Windows:**
- Download the installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Run the installer with default settings

**macOS:**
- Install using Homebrew: `brew install git`
- Or download from https://git-scm.com/download/mac

**Linux:**
- For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install git`
- For Fedora: `sudo dnf install git`

### Configuring Git

Set up your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Optional but recommended configurations:
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main  # Set default branch to main
git config --global color.ui auto  # Enable color output
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # Set VS Code as default editor
```

## 3. GitHub Repositories

### Creating a New Repository

**From the GitHub website:**
1. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
2. Select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose public or private
6. Optionally initialize with README, .gitignore, and license
7. Click "Create repository"

**From the command line:**
```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub
# Then initialize locally:
echo "# My Project" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Cloning an Existing Repository

```bash
# HTTPS method
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

# SSH method (requires SSH key setup)
git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git

# Clone to a specific folder
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git my-folder
```

### Forking a Repository

Forking creates a copy of someone else's repository in your GitHub account:

1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination

## 4. Basic Git Operations

### Working with Local Changes

```bash
# Check status of your working directory
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt  # Add specific file
git add .             # Add all changed files
git add *.js          # Add all JavaScript files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

# Commit all tracked files directly
git commit -am "Made these changes"

# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline --graph  # Compact view with branch graph
```

### Branching and Merging

```bash
# List all branches
git branch

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-name

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature-name

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge feature-name

# Delete a branch after merging
git branch -d feature-name

# Force delete a branch
git branch -D feature-name
```

### Working with Remote Repositories

```bash
# View remote repositories
git remote -v

# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

# Push changes to remote
git push origin branch-name

# Push and set upstream
git push -u origin branch-name

# Pull changes from remote
git pull origin branch-name

# Fetch changes without merging
git fetch origin
```

## 5. GitHub Collaboration Features

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are GitHub's way to propose changes and collaborate on code reviews:

  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16'
