Suggestion #2: Constants and Configuration

ISSUE:
The code contains many magic strings and numbers scattered throughout, making it difficult to maintain and modify. Hardcoded values reduce flexibility and can lead to inconsistencies.

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
Current hardcoded values identified in the codebase:
- String literals: "All Columns", "crew_gui.log", "./data/npcs.csv"
- UI dimensions: width=140, height=5, height=8
- Default file paths and extensions
- Cache durations and TTS chunk lengths
- Column headers and data field names

IMPACT OF CURRENT APPROACH:
- Changes require searching through the entire codebase
- Risk of missing instances when making updates
- Inconsistent values across different parts of the application
- Difficulty in making the application configurable for different environments

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

1. **Create Constants Module:**
   ```python
   # constants.py
   class UIConstants:
       LEFT_FRAME_WIDTH = 140
       GROUP_LIST_HEIGHT = 5
       DATA_TABLE_HEIGHT = 8
       DEFAULT_COLUMN_WIDTH = 100
   
   class FileConstants:
       DEFAULT_DATA_PATH = "./data/npcs.csv"
       LOG_FILE_NAME = "crew_gui.log"
       SCRIPTS_FOLDER = "scripts"
       CONFIG_FILE = "config.json"
   
   class TTSConstants:
       DEFAULT_CHUNK_LENGTH = 1000
       DEFAULT_RATE = 200
       DEFAULT_VOLUME = 0.7
   
   class DataConstants:
       ALL_COLUMNS_FILTER = "All Columns"
       DEFAULT_CACHE_DURATION = 300  # seconds
   ```

2. **Enhanced Configuration System:**
   - Extend the existing `Config` object to handle more settings
   - Add user-configurable options for UI layout, file locations, TTS settings

3. **Environment-Specific Configuration:**
   - Override defaults with user preferences
   - Persist user changes
   - Configuration file versioning and migration

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Create constants.py module with categorized constants
2. Create enhanced configuration management system
3. Systematically replace hardcoded values throughout the codebase
4. Add configuration UI for user-adjustable settings
5. Implement configuration file versioning and migration

BENEFITS:
- Centralized configuration management
- Easier maintenance and updates
- User customization capabilities
- Environment-specific deployments
- Reduced risk of inconsistencies
- Better code readability

ESTIMATED IMPACT: Medium-High - Significantly improves maintainability and adds user customization capabilities.
