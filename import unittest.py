"""
This script appears to be a test or utility related to Python's `unittest` module.

Given its name `import unittest.py`, it might be intended to:
1.  Test the importability of the `unittest` module itself.
2.  Serve as a basic template or example for creating unit tests.
3.  Be part of an educational exercise on how to use `unittest`.

Without specific content, its exact purpose is to demonstrate or test
the `unittest` framework's availability or basic usage.

# import unittest # This line would typically be present if it's functional

# Example of what might be in such a file:

# class TestMyModule(unittest.TestCase):
#     def test_example_function(self):
#         # from my_module import example_function # Assuming my_module exists
#         # self.assertEqual(example_function(2, 2), 4)
#         pass # Placeholder for an actual test
#
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     unittest.main()

print("Script 'import unittest.py' executed or imported.")
# If this file is meant to be a runnable test script, it would typically
# discover and run tests, or define test cases.
