Suggestion 10: __init__ Logging Comment Clarity

PROBLEM:
Misleading comment: "self.setup_logging() # os is used here, but this line is commented out"

ISSUES:
- os is not used in setup_logging()
- setup_logging() is actually called, not commented out
- Comment creates confusion

SOLUTION:
Remove or clarify the misleading comment:

```python
# Current:
self.setup_logging() # os is used here, but this line is commented out

# Fix:
self.setup_logging()  # Initialize logging configuration
```

BENEFITS:
- Removes confusion
- Accurate documentation
- Cleaner code comments
