3. Thread and UI Synchronization
   - Consolidate background thread management using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
   - Use thread-safe queues or `root.after()` exclusively for GUI updates to avoid race conditions.

# Detailed Implementation Guidance (Appended)

- Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for all background tasks.
- For GUI updates from threads, use `root.after()` or a thread-safe queue.
- Avoid direct widget updates from non-main threads.
- Refactor thread creation to use a single `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- Replace direct widget updates in threads with `root.after()` calls.
- No changes to TTS setup or configuration.
