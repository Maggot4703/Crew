Suggestion 9: TTS Text Preprocessing Unification

PROBLEM:
Two text cleaning functions exist: _clean_text (simple) and preprocess_text_for_speech (comprehensive).

SOLUTION:
Use preprocess_text_for_speech consistently throughout the codebase for all TTS operations.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Replace _clean_text calls with preprocess_text_for_speech
2. Or make _clean_text a wrapper around preprocess_text_for_speech
3. Ensure all TTS operations use the comprehensive cleaning

BENEFITS:
- Consistent text processing quality
- Better TTS speech output
- Reduced code duplication
- Single source of truth for text cleaning logic
