Suggestion 3: Cross-Platform Compatibility

PROBLEM:
The _open_scripts_folder method uses xdg-open, which is Linux-specific.

CURRENT CODE:
```python
def _open_scripts_folder(self):
    scripts_folder = "./scripts"
    if os.path.exists(scripts_folder):
        subprocess.run(['xdg-open', scripts_folder])
```

SOLUTION:
Add cross-platform support for opening folders:

```python
import platform
import subprocess
import os

def _open_scripts_folder(self):
    scripts_folder = "./scripts"
    if not os.path.exists(scripts_folder):
        self.update_status("Scripts folder does not exist")
        return
        
    try:
        system = platform.system()
        if system == "Darwin":  # macOS
            subprocess.run(['open', scripts_folder])
        elif system == "Windows":
            os.startfile(scripts_folder)
        else:  # Linux and other Unix-like systems
            subprocess.run(['xdg-open', scripts_folder])
    except Exception as e:
        self.update_status(f"Failed to open scripts folder: {e}")
```

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
Use the webbrowser module for a simpler approach:

```python
import webbrowser
import os

def _open_scripts_folder(self):
    scripts_folder = "./scripts"
    if os.path.exists(scripts_folder):
        webbrowser.open(f"file://{os.path.abspath(scripts_folder)}")
    else:
        self.update_status("Scripts folder does not exist")
```

BENEFITS:
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Better error handling
- More professional user experience
