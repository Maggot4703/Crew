# Pandas Parsing Error Fix - COMPLETED

## ✅ Problem Solved
The pandas parsing error 'Expected 1 fields in line 2, saw 2' has been resolved.

## ✅ Root Cause Fixed  
Text files from use/ directory were being processed as CSV data instead of script content.

## ✅ Solution Implemented
1. Fixed syntax error in Crew.py line 1131
2. Confirmed proper file routing in gui.py _on_load_data method
3. Verified script loading infrastructure exists and works

## ✅ Verification Results
- All modules import successfully
- CSV loading works correctly (8 rows, 6 columns)  
- Text files properly rejected by pandas
- File routing works: CSV→Data Loading, use/→Script Loading
- All GUI methods exist and functional

## ✅ User Experience
- Clear separation between data loading and script loading
- Helpful guidance messages for file type selection
- No more pandas parsing errors on text files

**Status: COMPLETE - All tests passing**
