Suggestion 11: Tkinter Widget Consistency

PROBLEM:
Code primarily uses ttk widgets but tk.Scale is used in _show_speech_settings.

CURRENT CODE:
```python
tk.Scale(...)  # In _show_speech_settings
```

SOLUTION:
Replace with ttk.Scale for consistency:

```python
# Replace:
rate_scale = tk.Scale(settings_frame, from_=0.5, to=2.0, 
                      resolution=0.1, orient='horizontal')

# With:
rate_scale = ttk.Scale(settings_frame, from_=0.5, to=2.0, 
                       orient='horizontal')
```

NOTE:
ttk.Scale doesn't have resolution parameter. Handle precision in the callback.

BENEFITS:
- Consistent modern look and feel
- Better theme support
- Professional appearance
