Suggestions for improving gui.py:

1.  **Modularity and Class Size:**
    *   The `CrewGUI` class is very large (over 2000 lines). Consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable classes. For example:
        *   TTS-related functionality could be encapsulated in a `TTSManager` class.
        *   File I/O operations (loading/saving data, text, scripts) could be grouped into a `FileManager` or `IOHelper` class.
        *   Complex UI panels, if they evolve, could become their own classes.

2.  **Constants and Configuration:**
    *   Replace magic strings and numbers with named constants (e.g., "All Columns", default widths, cache durations, TTS chunk lengths, default file paths like "./data/npcs.csv", log file name "crew_gui.log"). This improves readability and maintainability.
    *   Consider making more paths and settings configurable, perhaps through the existing `Config` object or a dedicated settings file.

3.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
    *   The `_open_scripts_folder` method uses `xdg-open`, which is Linux-specific. For broader compatibility, add checks and alternatives for other operating systems:
        *   Windows: `os.startfile(path)`
        *   macOS: `subprocess.run(['open', path])`

4.  **Custom Event `<<TreeviewPopulated>>` for Column Widths:**
    *   The custom event `<<TreeviewPopulated>>` bound in `create_data_section` is not standard.
    *   **Recommendation:** Instead of relying on this event, call the `apply_saved_column_widths` method directly at the end of `_update_data_view` after the Treeview has been populated with columns and data. This simplifies the logic.

5.  **`auto_import_py_files` Function:**
    *   This function is quite long. Consider refactoring parts of its logic (e.g., file skipping rules, import attempt logic) into smaller helper functions to improve readability.
    *   The `dangerous_patterns` check on the first 20 lines is a heuristic. While useful, acknowledge its limitations in documentation if this feature is critical for security.

6.  **`create_new_view_section` Placeholder:**
    *   The "Saver" button in `create_new_view_section` currently has a `print` statement as its command. Replace this with actual functionality or remove the button if it's only an example.

7.  **Redundant `hasattr` Checks:**
    *   In `bind_events`, some `hasattr` checks (e.g., for `self.filter_var`, `self._refresh_views`) might be unnecessary if the corresponding attributes are guaranteed to be initialized before `bind_events` is called. Review if these are truly needed or if they mask potential initialization order issues. The check for `self.filter_entry_widget` in `create_menu_bar` is appropriate due to creation order.

8.  **`_on_treeview_configure` Method:**
    *   This method is defined but does not appear to be bound to any `<Configure>` event. If it's intended for dynamic, proportional column resizing when the window/pane resizes, it needs to be bound to the `data_table` or its parent frame's `<Configure>` event.

9.  **TTS Text Preprocessing:**
    *   There are two functions for text cleaning/preprocessing: `_clean_text` (simpler) and `preprocess_text_for_speech` (more comprehensive).
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider unifying these or consistently using `preprocess_text_for_speech` where appropriate, as it offers more robust cleaning for TTS.

10. **Clarity in `__init__` Logging Comment:**
    *   The comment `self.setup_logging() # os is used here, but this line is commented out` is misleading. `os` is not used in `setup_logging`, and the method `setup_logging()` is indeed called. Remove or clarify this comment.

11. **Tkinter Widget Consistency:**
    *   The code primarily uses `ttk` widgets, which is good. However, `tk.Scale` is used in `_show_speech_settings`. `ttk.Scale` is available and would provide a more consistent look and feel. `tk.Text` and `tk.Menu` are fine as they don't have direct `ttk` replacements with identical APIs.

12. **Error Handling in `_save_data_to_file`:**
    *   The current error handling logs the error, shows a `messagebox`, and updates the status. This is good. Ensure this pattern is consistent for user-facing file operations.

13. **Code Comments and Docstrings:**
    *   The code has a good amount of comments. Continue to ensure that complex logic sections have clear explanations.
    *   Add module-level docstrings and class-level docstrings to explain the purpose of `gui.py` and the `CrewGUI` class.
    *   Ensure method docstrings clearly explain parameters, return values, and side effects, especially for public-facing methods.

14. **Hardcoded UI Values:**
    *   Values like `width=140` for `left_frame`, `height=5` for `group_list`, `height=8` for `data_table` are hardcoded. While this works, consider if making these adaptable or configurable (e.g., based on font size or a configuration setting) would be beneficial for accessibility or different display resolutions. For `PanedWindow` children, using `weight` is often more flexible than fixed pixel sizes unless a fixed size is strictly required.

15. **Scripts Directory Creation in `_update_script_menu`:**
    *   The `_update_script_menu` method attempts to re-create the scripts directory if it's missing. This is good for robustness. Ensure that user permissions issues are handled gracefully (e.g., logging the error if creation fails).

16. **Pandas and CustomTkinter Availability:**
    *   The checks for `PANDAS_AVAILABLE` and `CTK_AVAILABLE` are well-implemented, allowing the application to degrade gracefully if these optional libraries are not present.

These suggestions aim to improve the program's maintainability, robustness, and user experience.
