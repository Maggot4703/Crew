read gui.py
DO NOT REMOVE CODE FROM gui.py - COMMENT OUT UNWANTED LINES if necessary,
I do not want to lose it all again!
check implementations of tts in gui.py - female voice does not affect output
inspect and suggest extra implementations in TTS and how they would 
be achieved - add more functionality if possible
create update/create tests and save in ./tests
gui.py is fragile - try not to move funcitons
supply all suggestions to gui_suggest.txt (overwrite)
(send errors to gui_test_fails.txt (overwrite))
inspect gui_suggest.txt and explain reasons (try to keep gui & tts 
operational) save explanation to gui_explain.txt (overwrite)

please make a copy of gui.py first (gui_copy.py (overwrite)), also create copies of other modified files.   then apply suggestions to copy
