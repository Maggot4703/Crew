read gui.py
DO NOT REMOVE CODE FROM gui.py - COMMENT OUT UNWANTED LINES if necessary,
I do not want to lose it all again!
inspect and suggest extra implementations in TTS and how they would 
be achieved - add more functionality if possible 
gui.py is fragile - try not to move funcitons
supply all suggestions to gui_suggest.txt (overwrite)
update/create tests as necessary: then run all tests 
(send errors to gui_test_fails.txt (overwrite))
inspect gui_suggest.txt and explain reasons (try to keep gui & tts 
operational) save explanation to gui_explain.txt (overwrite)
