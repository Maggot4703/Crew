Suggestion #1: Modularity and Class Size

ISSUE:
The `CrewGUI` class is very large (over 2000 lines), making it difficult to maintain, debug, and extend. Large classes violate the Single Responsibility Principle and make the codebase harder to understand.

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
The current `CrewGUI` class handles multiple responsibilities:
- GUI layout and widget management
- TTS (Text-to-Speech) functionality
- File I/O operations
- Data management and filtering
- Script execution
- Configuration management
- Event handling

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

1. **TTSManager Class:**
   - Extract all TTS-related methods:
     - `_show_speech_settings()`
     - `_read_selection()`
     - `_read_all_details()`
     - `_clean_text()`
     - `preprocess_text_for_speech()`
     - `_stop_speech()`
   - Benefits: Encapsulates TTS logic, easier to test, can be reused in other parts of the application

2. **FileManager/IOHelper Class:**
   - Extract file operations:
     - `_load_data_from_file()`
     - `_save_data_to_file()`
     - `_export_to_csv()`
     - `_import_from_csv()`
     - `auto_import_py_files()`
     - Script loading/saving operations
   - Benefits: Centralized file handling, easier error management, improved security

3. **DataManager Class:**
   - Extract data manipulation:
     - Filtering logic
     - Data validation
     - Search functionality
     - Data transformation methods
   - Benefits: Separation of data logic from UI, easier testing

4. **ScriptManager Class:**
   - Extract script-related functionality:
     - `_update_script_menu()`
     - `_run_selected_script()`
     - `_open_scripts_folder()`
   - Benefits: Isolated script execution environment, better security control

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Create new classes in separate modules
2. Use composition pattern - CrewGUI would contain instances of these managers
3. Implement clear interfaces between classes
4. Gradually refactor methods one by one to maintain functionality

BENEFITS:
- Improved maintainability
- Better testability
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier debugging
- Potential for code reuse
- More manageable codebase

ESTIMATED IMPACT: High - This would significantly improve the architecture and long-term maintainability of the application.
