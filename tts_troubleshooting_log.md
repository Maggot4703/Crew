## Test 6: Python `pyttsx3` Script Test (PulseAudio Running)

**Command:** `./tts_venv/bin/python test_tts.py`
**Console Output:**
```
Testing female voice...
Found English voice: english
Set female voice: english+f3
Running engine...
Test completed.
```
**Expected:** Audible speech with female voice.
**Actual Result:** Audible speech with female voice characteristics confirmed by user.
**Interpretation:** `pyttsx3` is correctly using `espeak` and the audio system, including the female voice variant. The TTS system is now fully functional.

## Troubleshooting Summary

The primary issue preventing audio output was that the PulseAudio sound server was not running. After manually starting PulseAudio using `pulseaudio -vvv --start`, `espeak` was able to produce sound, and subsequently, the Python `pyttsx3` scripts also functioned correctly, including the female voice modification.

## Further Attempts to Automate PulseAudio Start (systemd)

Attempts were made to enable and start PulseAudio using `systemctl --user` commands:

1. `systemctl --user status pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket`: Showed both as inactive.
2. `systemctl --user start pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket`: Failed to start `pulseaudio.service`.
3. `systemctl --user enable pulseaudio.socket pulseaudio.service && systemctl --user start pulseaudio.socket && systemctl --user start pulseaudio.service`: This also failed to start `pulseaudio.service`.

**Conclusion:**

Starting PulseAudio via `systemctl --user` is not reliably working in this environment. The manual start command (`pulseaudio --start` or `pulseaudio -vvv --start` for verbose output) remains the effective method to ensure the sound server is running for the TTS tools. For a persistent solution, users might need to investigate their specific desktop environment's autostart procedures for PulseAudio or address the underlying `systemctl --user` startup issue.
