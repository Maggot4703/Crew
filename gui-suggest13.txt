Suggestion 13: Code Comments and Docstrings

PROBLEM:
Need module-level and class-level docstrings, plus better method documentation.

SOLUTION:
Add comprehensive documentation:

```python
"""
Crew GUI Application

This module provides a comprehensive GUI interface for managing crew data,
including TTS functionality, data filtering, and script management.
"""

class CrewGUI:
    """
    Main GUI application for crew management.
    
    Provides functionality for:
    - Data viewing and editing
    - Text-to-speech operations
    - Script management
    - Configuration handling
    """
    
    def method_name(self, param1, param2):
        """
        Method description.
        
        Args:
            param1 (type): Description
            param2 (type): Description
            
        Returns:
            type: Description
            
        Raises:
            ExceptionType: Description
        """
```

BENEFITS:
- Better code documentation
- Easier maintenance
- Improved developer experience
