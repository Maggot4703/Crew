The file contains multiple lines of text that should be displayed
in the Details View when the text file is loaded through the
File > Load Data menu option.

Features of this text file:
- Multiple paragraphs
- Line breaks
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()
- Numbers: 123456789

This demonstrates that the GUI can now handle text files
in addition to CSV and Excel files, providing a comprehensive
data viewing experience.
