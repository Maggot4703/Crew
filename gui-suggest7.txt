Suggestion 7: Redundant hasattr Checks Review

PROBLEM:
Some hasattr checks in bind_events may be unnecessary if attributes are guaranteed to exist.

CURRENT QUESTIONABLE CHECKS:
- hasattr(self, 'filter_var') - should always exist after __init__
- hasattr(self, '_refresh_views') - methods should always exist

SOLUTION:
1. Review initialization order in __init__
2. Remove unnecessary method existence checks
3. Keep widget checks where creation order matters

EXAMPLE FIXES:
```python
# Remove unnecessary method check:
# if hasattr(self, '_refresh_views'):
self._refresh_views()  # Call directly

# Keep necessary widget checks:
if hasattr(self, 'filter_entry_widget') and self.filter_entry_widget:
    # This is appropriate due to creation order
```

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
- Verify all attributes are properly initialized before bind_events
- Check if any hasattr checks are masking real initialization issues

BENEFITS:
- Cleaner, more direct code
- Better error detection during development
- Avoids masking initialization order problems
