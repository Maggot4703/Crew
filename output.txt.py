"""
This script appears to be intended for redirecting output or logging.

Given its name `output.txt.py`, it might be a placeholder or a script
that was intended to manage how text output is handled, possibly by
writing to a file named `output.txt` or similar.

Without further context or content, its exact purpose is unclear.
It could be used for:
- Redirecting `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.
- Implementing a custom logging handler.
- Storing execution results or logs.
"""

# This is a placeholder for the actual content of output.txt.py
# If this file is meant to be a Python script, its code would go here.

# Example: If it were for redirecting print statements to a file:
# import sys
# sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
# print("This will be written to output.txt")
# sys.stdout.close() # Remember to close it or use a context manager
# sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__ # Restore standard output

# If it's just a marker or a misnamed text file, it might be empty or contain plain text.

print("output.txt.py was executed")  # Placeholder action
